However, user can also decide use correlation methods, Pearson's Kendall's correlation. Nevertheless, NGS data may happen certain number ties present expression values. can handled spearman method computes tie-corrected version Spearman's coefficients. However, another correlation method suitable perform rank correlation tied data Kendall's tau-b method, usable kendall. Regarding correlation direction, since miRNAs mainly act negative regulators, negatively correlated miRNA-target pairs evaluated, statistical significance calculated one-tailed t-test. Please notice strong batch effects noticed expression data, recommended remove batchCorrection() function implemented MIRit. Moreover, gene expression data miRNA expression data derive different samples (unpaired data), correlation analysis performed. However, one-sided association tests can applied cases evaluate targets -regulated miRNAs statistically enriched -regulated genes, , conversely, targets -regulated miRNAs statistically enriched -regulated genes. case, Fisher's exact test can used assess statistical significance inverse association. Moreover, Lancaster's mid-p adjustment can applied since shown increases statistical power retaining Type error rates. However, Fisher's exact test conditional test requires sum rows columns contingency table fixed. Notably, true genomic data likely different datasets may lead different number DEGs. Therefore, default behavior MIRit use variant Barnard's exact test, named Boschloo's exact test, suitable group sizes contingency tables variable. Moreover, possible demonstrate Boschloo's test uniformly powerful compared Fisher's exact test. Finally, unpaired data, effect DE-miRNAs expression target genes can estimated rotation gene-set tests. particular, fast approximation rotation gene-set testing called fry, implemented limma package, can used statistically quantify influence miRNAs expression changes target genes.","code":""},{"path":"/reference/mirnaIntegration.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Integrate microRNA and gene expression — mirnaIntegration","text":"Ritchie , Phipson B, Wu D, Hu Y, Law CW, Shi W, Smyth GK (2015). “limma powers differential expression analyses RNA-sequencing microarray studies.” Nucleic Acids Research, 43(7), e47. doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007.

See BiocParallel::bpparam() details. , progress bar can also included show completion percentage setting progress = TRUE. Moreover, user can define frequently progress bar gets updated tweaking tasks parameter. using progress = TRUE, setting tasks 100 tells function update progress bar 100 times, user can see increases 1%. Instead, setting tasks 50, means progress bar gets updated every 2% completion. However, keep mind tasks values 50 100 lead 15-30% slower p-value calculation due increased data transfer workers. Instead, lower tasks values like 20 determine less frequent progress updates slightly less efficient including progress bar.","code":""},{"path":"/reference/topologicalAnalysis.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Perform a topologically-aware integrative pathway analysis (TAIPA) — topologicalAnalysis","text":"Peter H.
