## Overview

`MIRit` (miRNA integration tool) is an open-source R package that aims to facilitate the comprehension of microRNA (miRNA) biology through the integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression data deriving from different platforms, including microarrays, RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics. Given their regulatory importance, a complete characterization of miRNA dysregulations results crucial to explore the molecular networks that may lead to the insurgence of complex diseases. To this purpose, we developed MIRit, an all-in-one framework that provides flexible and powerful methods for performing integrative miRNA-mRNA multi-omic analyses from start to finish.

## Installation

`MIRit` is currently undergoing Bioconductor submission. In the meantime, you
can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/jacopo-ronchi/MIRit) with:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("jacopo-ronchi/MIRit")
```

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to use `MIRit` for integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis, please refer to the package vignette on
[Bioconductor](). Alternatively, you can refer to the [documentation website](http://jacopo-ronchi.github.io/MIRit).

## Citation

If you use `MIRit` in published research, please cite the corresponding paper:
