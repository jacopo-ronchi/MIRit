## Overview

`MIRit` (miRNA integration tool) is an open-source R package that aims
to facilitate the comprehension of microRNA (miRNA) biology through the
integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression data deriving from
different platforms, including microarrays, RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq,
proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics. Given their regulatory
importance, a complete characterization of miRNA dysregulations results
crucial to explore the molecular networks that may lead to the
insurgence of complex diseases. To this purpose, we developed MIRit, an
all-in-one framework that provides flexible and powerful methods for
performing integrative miRNA-mRNA multi-omic analyses from start to
finish.

## Installation

`MIRit` is currently undergoing Bioconductor submission. In the
meantime, you can install it from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jacopo-ronchi/MIRit) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("jacopo-ronchi/MIRit")
```

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to use `MIRit` for integrative
miRNA-mRNA analysis, please refer to the package vignette on
[Bioconductor](). Alternatively, you can refer to the [documentation
website](http://jacopo-ronchi.github.io/MIRit).

## Citation

If you use `MIRit` in published research, please cite the corresponding
paper:

> identification of impaired miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in complex
> diseases’. bioRxiv (2023). <doi:10.1101/2023.11.24.568528>

Please note that the `MIRit` package was made possible thanks to many
other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in
the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
