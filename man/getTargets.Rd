\usage{
getTargets(
  mirnaObj,
  organism = "Homo sapiens",
  score = "High",
  includeValidated = TRUE,
  evidence = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mirnaObj}{A \code{\link[=MirnaExperiment-class]{MirnaExperiment}} object
containing miRNA and gene data}

\item{organism}{The specie for which you are retrieving miRNA target genes.
Available species are: \verb{Homo sapiens} (default), \verb{Mus musculus},
\verb{Rattus norvegicus}, \verb{Arabidopsis thaliana}, \verb{Bos taurus},
\verb{Caenorhabditis elegans}, \verb{Danio rerio}, \verb{Drosophila melanogaster},
\verb{Gallus gallus}, \verb{Sus scrofa}}

\item{score}{The minimum mirDIP confidence score. It must be one of
\verb{Very High}, \code{High} (default), \code{Medium}, \code{Low}, which correspond to ranks
among top 1\%, top 5\% (excluding top 1\%), top 1/3 (excluding top 5\%) and
remaining predictions, respectively}

\item{includeValidated}{Logical, whether to include validated interactions
from miRTarBase or not. Default is TRUE in order to retrieve both predicted
and validated targets. Note that for species other than Homo sapines only
validated interactions are considered.}

\item{evidence}{The support evidence required for miRTarBase validated
interactions. The possible options are \code{strong}, to only include targets
with strong experimental support, and \code{all} (default) to also include
validated interactions with less strong evidence.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[=MirnaExperiment-class]{MirnaExperiment}} object containing miRNA targets
stored in the \code{targets} slot. Results can be accessed with the
\code{\link[=mirnaTargets]{mirnaTargets()}} function.

\description{
This function allows to obtain human miRNA-target interactions using two
databases, namely miRTarBase v10, which contains experimentally validated
interactions, and the microRNA Data Integration Portal (mirDIP) database,
which aggregates miRNA target predictions from 24 different resources by
using an integrated score inferred from different prediction metrics. In
this way, as demonstrated by Tokar et al. 2018, mirDIP reports more accurate
predictions compared to those of individual tools. However, for species
other than Homo sapiens only validated interactions are returned, since
mirDIP is only available for human miRNAs.
}
\details{
To define miRNA target genes, we can consider both experimentally validated
and computationally predicted interactions. Interactions of the former type
are generally preferred, since they are corroborated by biomolecular
experiments. However, they are often not sufficient, thus making it necessary
to consider the predicted interactions as well. The downside of miRNA target
prediction algorithms is the scarce extend of overlap existing between the
different tools. To address this issue, several ensemble methods have been
developed, trying to aggregate the predictions obtained by different
algorithms. Initially, several researchers determined as significant
miRNA-target pairs those predicted by more than one tool (intersection
method). However, this method is not able to capture an important number of
meaningful interactions. Alternatively, other strategies used to merge
predictions from several algorithms (union method). Despite identifying more
true relationships, the union method leads to a higher proportion of false
discoveries. Therefore, other ensemble methods including mirDIP started using
other statistics to rank miRNA-target predictions obtained by multiple
algorithms. For additional information on mirDIP database and its ranking
metric check Tokar et al. 2018 and Hauschild et al. 2023.

This function defines miRNA targets by considering both validated
interactions present in miRTarBase (version 10), and predicted interactions
identified by mirDIP. Please note that for species other than Homo sapiens,
only miRTarBase interactions are available. Further, it is possible to
include all validated miRNA-target interactions, or limit the retrieval to
interactions with strong supporting evidence.
